main1.R is an example code. Procedure and explanation of the code are described below.

1. Simulation.R is a script for generating data based on a factor analysis model. 
Change the script for different setting. If empirical data are used, comment out the source("Simulation.R") and change the command for data input, i.e., "DataMat<-read.table("SimulatedData.txt",header=F)".

2. Change the dimension setting in main1.R 

3. Prior.R is a script for setting the hyperparameters in the prior distributions. Change the hyperparameters as needed. 

4. ind.R is a script for setting if the elements in the loading matrix and intercept to be fixed, estimated like common Bayesian CFA, or with SSP. Change the setting as needed. 

5. init1.R sets the initial values of the parameters. Change the settings and the values as needed.

6. The "BFA" function conduct the Bayesian factor analysis, the MCMC samples are returned as a list.

7. Calculate the posterior mean, SE and posterior model inclusion probabilities (if SSP is used) with the "MCMCSummary" function

8. If the model is a confirmatory model (no 2 in ind.R), use the "BayesianMCC" function to calculate the Bayesian model comparison criteria, including the marginal model probability for Bayes factor, BIC, DIC, and LOO-PSIS.

9. If the model uses SSP for some loading, 
9.1 In CandidateModelsIdentification.R, Describe the loading structure of the candidate models
9.2 use MMP_SSP function to calculate the marginal model probability for Bayes factor
